**1. Think of something in your life that you could track using a database.**

Since I'm very fond of music I could track my music playlist on Spotify:

1. I could track all my of songs in one table and have another table in which I record the authors. This would be a *one-to-many* relationship from the perspective of the author tables.

**1. What entities in this database might have one-to-many relationships with one another? Many-to-many?**

1. If I were to be a data analyst working for Spotify I could track the following tables: (1) A table that indicates if a song was "liked" and (2) another table for the users. This would be a *many-to-many* relationship because a song can be liked by many users and an user can like many songs as well.
